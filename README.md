 <h1>BMW E46 M3</h1>
            
    <p1>The E46 M3, first introduced in October 2000, appeared worldwide with the new 3.2 L S54 M-tuned engine..</p1><br>
    <img style="-webkit-user-select: none" src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/49/14/01/49140147e8430614eabcf2a87f52d37f.jpg"><br>
  
    <p2>The E46 M3 was offered with a standard 6-speed Getrag transmission, but optionally came with a SMG drivelogic transmission (also known as the SMG II)<br> This is the standard 6-speed Getrag transmission with an electrohydraulically actuated clutch (no clutch pedal). Shifts are made via the SMG gear knob or the steering wheel mounted paddle shifters.<br> The engine had a redline of 8,000 rpm. As with most M engines, the S54 again had 6 independent throttle bodies and this time electronically operated throttles - Wikipedia </p2><br>
    
    <p3>Today, the E46 M3 is one of the most affprdable german sports cars on the road. Even though these cars are over 10 years old, they run well, and dont look as old as they are with the timeless styling.</p3>
